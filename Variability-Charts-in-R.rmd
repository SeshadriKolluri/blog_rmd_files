Variability Gauge Charts, ([example from JMP website](http://www.jmp.com/support/help/Variability_Gauge_Charts.shtml)), are very useful to quickly compare the influence of multiple factor variables on a process. Those are one of the staple graphs for semiconductor engineers. 

Below is an attempt at creating a basic Variability Chart in R using `ggplot2` package. For simplicity, I have expanded the ggplot command into multiple sub-commands. 

I hope you fidn this useful

```{r varibility_chart_example, message=FALSE}
require(ggplot2)
data(mpg)

# create a plot with Y and the first category variable. 
p <- ggplot(mpg,aes(drv,hwy))

# add the box plots
p <- p + geom_boxplot() 

# apply the second category variable. 
# choose nrow = 1 so that, we see all the plots in one row. 
p <- p + facet_wrap(~class, nrow = 1 , strip.position = "bottom" , labeller = "label_both" )

# add jitter to the points so that they are all not clustered together. 
p <- p + geom_jitter(width=.2, height=0)

# Change axis labels etc. 

p <- p + labs(y = "Highway Mileage", x = "Drive [4-Wheel / Forward / Reverse]")

# display the plot
p

```
